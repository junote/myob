### zr_openroadm

400G ZR sets a standard for transferring 400 Gigabit Ethernet over a single optical wavelength, utilizing technologies like DWDM (dense wavelength division multiplexing) and higher-order modulation such as 16 QAM. Developed by the [Optical Interoperability Forum](https://www.oiforum.com/) (OIF), this cost-effective solution establishes an interoperable interface for 400G data transmission, marking one of the initial standards in this domain.

Open ROADM is a [400G pluggable](https://www.fs.com/products/147091.html?c_site=community&c_ctype=knowledge&c_from=wordlink&c_cat=BMCS220004-400G-Wiki&c_rel=29491) solution that establishes interoperability standards for **Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADM)**, responsible for managing and routing data traffic over high-capacity fiber-optic lines. Initially developed in response to the surge in wireless network traffic from 2007 to 2015, Open ROADM consists of key components including ROADM switches, transponders, and pluggable optics. These components are controllable via an open standards-based API accessed through an SDN Controller using the NETCONF protocol.
